# Tracking Eye Movement Exercise
> Exercise started in week 8 of MIT Full Stack Development Professional Certificate Program

## Project Goals
Have eyes track mouse movement.

## Project Details
The "eyes" on the screen are created from 4 files:
1. The eye outline svg file (the black lines with a gray background)
2. The eye white svg file
3. The eye iris svg file
4. The pupil is a simple rounded div

Creating the images from multiple svg files allowed me to put each one on a separate z-index while also keeping them aligned.

## Project Implementation
This project is available live at <kparsonsDesign.github.io/eyeMovement>.
It is currently only formatted for computer screens (it requres a mouse to move the eyes).

## Updates
- Make eyes resize/reorient on window resize
- Make eye tracking follow touch event for mobile
