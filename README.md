# Tracking Eye Movement Exercise
> Exercise started in week 8 of MIT Full Stack Developer Professional Certificate Program

## Project Goals
Have eyes track mouse movement.

## Project Details
The "eyes" on the screen are created from 3 files:
1. The eye outline svg file (the black lines with a gray background)
2. The eye white is the background color of the div containing the iris image
3. The eye iris and pupil svg file

Creating the images from multiple svg files allowed me to put each one on a separate z-index while also keeping them aligned.

## Project Implementation
This project is available live at [kparsonsdesign.github.io/eyemovement](kparsonsdesign.github.io/eyemovement).
It is currently only formatted for computer screens (it requres a mouse to move the eyes).

## Updates
- Make eyes resize/reorient on window resize
- Make eye tracking follow touch event for mobile
